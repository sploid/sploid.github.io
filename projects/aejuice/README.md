# AEJuice Pack Manager 4

Jul 2020 - Present

In this article I would like to tell you about the product AEJuice Pack Manager 4. This product includes one separate application and plug-ins for Adobe After Effect and Adobe Premiere Pro. The insides of the application and plug-ins are the same, the only difference is how the main window is displayed to the user. This application is a showcase of AEJuice products and provides the ability to conveniently work with them.

## Tasks

- The application was launched from scratch. The previous version of the application was available, but its code could not be used due to its quality. The design was partially borrowed from the previous version of the application.
- CI/CD was set up. In the first version, the build was set up based on Jenkins, then transferred to Github Actions. The build was implemented using lua scripts.
- Installers for Windows and macOS were implemented, as well as automatic application updates.
- I was engaged in solving problems from users, acting as the second line of support. I was also engaged in training first-line support specialists.
- I set up application performance monitoring based on Graphite + Grafana.
- I was engaged in finding employees, conducting interviews and onboarding.
- Integration with Adobe Premiere Pro was implemented through dll-injection, since this tool does not allow writing plugins in C++.
- I managed a team of up to two people. I formalized tasks from management, distributed them among the team and monitored their implementation.
- Implemented application protection using VMProtect.
